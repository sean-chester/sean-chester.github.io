Dr. Sean Chester is an assistant professor in Computer science at the University of Victoria in Canada. He specialises in _data management on 
modern, highly parallel architectures_, such as graphics processing cards (GPUs) and multi-socket (i.e., NUMA) CPUs. His research typically appears 
in top database periodicals: PVLDB, ACM SIGMOD, and IEEE ICDE.

From 2017-2019, he held a prestigious Horizon 2020 Marie-Sk≈Çodowska Curie fellowship from the _European Research Council_, which he tenured
at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. Previously, he had been a postdoc at Aarhus University (Denmark)
and a graduate student at the University of Victoria (Canada).

Currently, his team is focusing on data-parallel, lock-free algorithms with applications in graph analytics, computer graphics, and natural language processing. We focus on combined theoretical-empirical validation with proofs of correctness and software prototypes to evaluate observed performance.
