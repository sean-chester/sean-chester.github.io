_We have one funded opening for a one-semester research internship to begin by September 2023. Applications will be reviewed by Tuesday 25 April 2023._

### Exploratory Visual Analytics in the Presence of Classifier Uncertainty

In this project, we would like to design better visual analytics tools to explore the uncertainty in machine learning classifications in real time. State-of-the-art techniques for visualising set-oriented data, such as is produced from classification and clustering algorithms, assume that every element of data can be uniquely and confidently attributed to a single set. However, we know that machine learning algorithms often produce their "best guess"; representing that information as factual can be quite misleading.

Visualising uncertainty is quite difficult, however, not just because it crowds and complicates the visualisations themselves, but also because it leads to very large execution times. As data scientists manipulate and interact with data, predictions and visualisations should be updated in real-time. We would like to extend existing systems that interface visual analytics with a high-performance, in-memory relational database. Specifically, we need to categorise how the performance of existing visualisation systems break down in the face of uncertainty, co-design data visualisation and database techniques to improve user interaction, and quantitatively analyse the efficacy of the data visualisations and algorithms that support them.

### Candidate Profile

If you apply to this position, please indicate evidence of your capacity to complete core competencies needed for this research, such as those below:

 - Write complex and efficient SQL queries to extract information from a relational database and plot it with a python package
 - Write python code to randomly sample events from the CDF of a custom probability distribution
 - Write a JavaScript function that inserts new HTML objects into a webpage
 - Write a clear and technically precise description in three paragraphs of the difference between the k-means and density-based clustering algorithms
 - Argue convincingly orally in English two opposing sides of a debate on a topic that you are knowledgeable

It is also helpful to mention having any of the following experience as an additional asset:
 - Taken a visualization or a visual analytics course
 - Knowledge of/experience with implementing custom visualization solutions/encodings (e.g., using Processing or d3.js)
 - Knowledge of/experience with designing studies involving humans (e.g., in psychology or human-computer interaction)
 - Experience summarising/describing the main contributions of primary research papers

It is likely possible to register the internship for co-op credit.

### Candidate Role

As a research intern, you would work full-time (35 hrs/wk) to complete an independent research project in collaboration with other members of the research team. On this particular project, you would have the following roles:
 - Determine how a set of user tasks identified in literature should be modified to account for prediction uncertainty
 - Design and implement algorithmic techniques, informed by data visualisation considerations, to refresh visual analytics
 - Design and implement a suite of experiments to empirically evaluate the algorithmic techniques
 - Write a report summarising the purpose, findings, and results of the project
 - Meet at least weekly with at least one project supervisor
 - Learn and work effectively in diverse, multi-cultural teams

If there is time, you would potentially also:
 - Design an evaluation study for visual analytics and implement a system to execute it [overlaps activities above]
 - Apply for Human Research Ethics, recruit participants and run the study
 - Analyze (statistically) the study data and report findings

### Application Process

This internship is funded by [The Matrix Institute](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/matrix/) at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) as [a Matrix Institute Scholarship](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/matrix/wp-content/uploads/sites/3543/2023/04/Scholarship-Program-Announcement.pdf). The application process and eligibility criteria are determined by the scholarship.

To be eligible, you _must_:
 * Be registered as a graduate student at the University of Victoria
 * Not have a supervisory relationship with either [Dr. Sean Chester](https://sean-chester.github.io/) or [Dr. Charles Perin](http://charlesperin.net/)


The timeline is as follows:
 * **By 25 April**: Contact Dr. Sean Chester by email (schester@uvic.ca) providing a CV and a brief statement of why you are interested in this position, and evidence related to the competencies described above.
 * **On 26 April**: Conduct interviews with up to four shortlisted students
 * **On 27 April**: One student is selected and will jointly prepare a scholarship proposal to submit to the Matrix Institute
 * **On 28 April**: Submission of final, jointly prepared scholarship proposal
 * **On 5 May**: Notification by Matrix Institute of scholarship recipients
 * **By 15 September**: Start a one-term research internship
