_We have two openings for self-funded project-based MSc candidates to begin by September 2023. Applications will be reviewed until filled._

### Parallel Algorithms and Data Management

For project-based master's programs, the research direction is decided jointly by Dr. Chester and the candidate after the first eight months and there is significant flexibility in its design. However, the topic should relate to material that Dr. Chester has either researched in the past or regularly teaches. To ensure alignment of interests, please refer to:
  * [selected recent publications](../publications/)
  * [materials related to Dr. Chester's senior-level course on concurrency](https://github.com/sean-chester/exploiting-modern-hardware)
  * [materials related to Dr. Chester's graduate-level course on data modelling](https://github.com/sean-chester/data-models-for-data-science)
  * [materials related to Dr. Chester's third-year course on database systems](https://github.com/sean-chester/relational-databases) 

### Candidate Profile

If you apply to this position, please try to position your strengths and/or interests with respect to the following:

 * How will you be successful in a master's program that requires completing a two-semester independent research project?
 * Can you develop software that manages memory resources effectively?
 * Can you design algorithms to solve a problem and prove that they are correct?


### Application Process

Formally, you must follow [the process outlined on the department website](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/computerscience/graduate/applying/index.php).

Informally, you should also:
  - contact me directly by email, positioning yourself with respect to the three questions above that characterise a successful candidate for this position
  - candidates who apply for time-sensitive positions will not hear back until those competitions close
  - candidates who show strong evidence will first be contacted for a technical interview; if that goes well, a second follow-up interview will take place, after which they will be notified whether or not a position will be extended in this hiring round

### What is a Project-Based MSc?

It is important to note that at the University of Victoria, we have [two options for master's degrees](https://www.uvic.ca/ecs/computerscience/graduate/masters/msc-programs/index.php): a _thesis_ option and a _project_ option.

The _thesis_ option is focused on a novel two-year scientific research investigation that culminates in a thesis that you must defend in front of a committee to graduate. The coursework is auxiliary and consists of only five courses that are complementary to your concurrent research. The thesis option is necessary if you intend to pursue further graduate studies, such as a PhD, and _highly_ advised if you wish to pursue a career in research and development (R&D).

The _project_ option requires eight graduate-level courses and a lighter one- or two-semester research project. Generally, it involves less interaction with the supervisor as less research guidance and mentorship is required until the final two semesters.

Students in both options are encouraged to spend one or two four-month semesters in paid research internships or work placements to improve post-graduation employment prospects and to earn income to help cover study expenses. They are also encouraged to take part-time positions as teaching assistants to provide additional income.
